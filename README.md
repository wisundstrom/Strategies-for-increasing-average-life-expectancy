# Increasing Average Life Expectancy
This project uses an elastic net linear regression to create a model that can
predict the average life expectancy in a county in the US, based on a diverse
set of information about each county. The structure of the model is then used to
determine which of the input features is most predictive of life expectancy, in
order to suggest possible policy interventions
